The tag is used to carry introductory material or a series of navigational links. We only use the tag for the main section of navigation links.
The tag is used to embed a picture on an HTML page. We use "src" to give the image's path. I'd want to put my website's logo here. I must expressly recognise that in order to use CSS functionalities. I've created a class called "logob" for this purpose.
The tag is used to specify an unordered list. The tag is used to begin the list item. The tag's "href" element is used to establish a hyperlink to web pages or anything else that a URL can address.  The destination of the link should be indicated by the tag. 

CSS can be introduced to HTML texts in three different methods. There are three types of CSS: inline, internal, and external. I've utilised an external CSS file in this case. The class selector is used to select HTML items that have a specified class property. The (.) character is used, followed by the class name.

There will be some layout changes when the page loads. We set width and height properties to avoid this. The "cursor" property illuminates the mouse pointer when it is positioned above an element.
When you hover your mouse over an element, we use ":hover" to select it. I've used the colour attribute to let him know he's clicked on the navigation components.
